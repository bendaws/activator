A basic visual wrapper over the Windows 10 and Windows 11 kms activation servers hosted by [msguides](https://msguides.com).
It is pretty easy to use, you just select "start activation" and select what edition of Windows you are using. 

It is built in .NET 8 but my releases are self-contained executables that bundle the .net runtime in them.
