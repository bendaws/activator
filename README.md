MSActivate is a simple and free way to activate Microsoft products (being Windows 10/11 or Office) by using the KMS servers provided by [msguides.com](https://msguides.com).
It is essentially a wrapper over the activation process. MSActivate will automatically install the KMS server with a key, and activate it for you.

It is built in .NET 8 but my releases are self-contained executables that bundle the .net runtime in them.
